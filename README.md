# Linked-List
In the first project, I designed a circular LinkedList with a sentinal node, and some requested functions; and also implemented a Queue data structure with basic push and pull methods, using my custom LinkedList class.
# Cycled-List
In this project, I designed a function called IsCycled that determines if a given list is Cycled (meaning if the last node of the list is refrencing another node in the list) or not.

This project uses the Linked List class from the first project with some adjustments and extra methods, enabling the user to make a list cycled or un-cycled in the console environment.
# Balanced-Brackets-using-Stacks
In this project, by using stack data structure ,which is implemented using the Linked List designed in the first project, I designed IsBalanced function, which determines if a given sequence of brackets are balanced* or not.

*being balanced here means that if each open bracket closes before a previous opened bracket
